POI object model:
---------------

WorkBook
    | (wb)     
    |	       wb = WorkBookFactory.create()
    V			wb = new XSSFWorkBook();
Sheet
    | (sh)     sh = wb.createSheet(<SheetName>);
    |          sh = wb.getSheet(<SheetName>);
    V
  Row
    | (row)    row = sh.createRow(<number>);
    |           row = sh.getRow(<number>);
    V
  Cell
    | (cell)    cell = row.createCell(<number>);
    |           cell = row.getCell(<number>);
