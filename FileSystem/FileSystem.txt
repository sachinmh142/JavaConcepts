File System:

It belongs to the package java.io
It is mainly used to perform file & directory related operations.

Classes in java.io:
1. File
It is used for file & Directory operations which are as follows:


Q: How to create object to the File class for file:
File f1 = new File("C:\\SG\\Sample.txt");

File f1 = new File("C:\\SG", "Sample.txt");

File f1 = new File("C:\\SG\\Sample.txt");
File f2 = f1;

File f1 = new File("C:\\SG\\Sample.txt");
File f2 = new File(f1.toString());


I. File operations
(a) createNewFile(): to create a new blank file. returns boolean
(b) renameTo(): to rename files OR to move (Cut & paste) files.returns boolean
(c) delete(): to delete the files which returns boolean
(d) deleteOnExit(): to delete the files which is void
(e) File attributes: to use all the file attributes


                most commonly used methods : File Attributes
                //getMethods : getFreeSpace , getAbsolutePath ,  getParent , getName , getTotalSpace
				//can methods : canWrite , canRead , canExecute
				//is : isDirectory , isFile  , isHidden , exists
				//set : setWritable , setReadOnly



(f) File collections: to work with collection of files.how many files are there in folder

         we use :
         
         list() and listFiles() methods .
         
         list() : returns String
         
         listFiles() : Files(object)

Q: How to create object to the File class for Directory:
File f1 = new File("C:\SG\Sample");

File f1 = new File("C:\\SG\\Sample");
File f2 = f1;

File f1 = new File("C:\\SG\\Sample");
File f2 = new File(f1.toString());


II. directory Operations
(a) mkDir(): to create a blank directory. Returns boolean
(b) mkDirs(): to create a nested directories. Returns boolean
(c) renameTo(): to rename OR to move the directories. Returns boolean
(d) delete(): to delete the directory which returns boolean
(e) deleteOnExit(): to delete directory which is void
(f) Directory attributes: to use all the directory attributes
(g) Directory collections: to work with collection of directories.

Note: using File class we can't perform read & write operations bcoz
 File class is not a Stream object.
========================================

Stream classes in File System for read & write purpose:
2 types of stream classes:
1. byte Stream classes
2. character stream classes

(i) byte stream classes
   (a) FileInputStream: Its used for reading purpose. 
   It reads the file content in the form of int & byte.

   (b) FileOutputStream: Its used for writing purpose. 
   It writes to the file in the form of int, byte



(ii) character stream classes
   (a) FileReader: Its used for reading purpose. 
   It reads the file content in the form of int, char ,& String

   (b) FileWriter: Its used for writing purpose. 
   It writes to the file in the form of int, char & String
   
******************************************************************************
  (c) BufferedReader: Its used for reading purpose. 
     It reads the file content in the form of int, char, String (line by line)

    BufferedReader accepts FileReader as a input.

  (d) BufferedWriter: Its used for writing purpose. It writes the content to the file in the form of int, char, String & newLine.

   BufferedWriter accepts FileWriter as a input.
